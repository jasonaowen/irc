ask:
  - >
    If you have a question but you don't want your fellow zombies to know that
    you're the one asking it, you can ask me and I will relay your question.
  - >
    Say 'ask: why is the sky blue?' and in your mentor channel I will say
    'why is the sky blue?'
  - >
    If you are in more than one channel that I am in, you can tell me which
    channel to ask in by saying 'ask in #example: why is water wet?' and, in
    #example, I will say 'why is water wet?'
  - >
    Your mentors will know that it was you who asked the question, though, so
    that they can help you directly if needed (and to prevent abuse).
join:
  - >
    To have me join a channel, you can simply invite me with your irc client.
  - >
    If the channel has a password, first say 'join #example sekritpassword',
    then invite me.
