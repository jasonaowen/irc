    When a story is forming, you can say "%(botname)s: I'm in" to be a part
    of the story when it starts. After a story has started, or while it is
    still forming, you can "/msg %(botname)s I'm in" to participate.
start:
  - >
    When you want storytime to start, tell %(botname)s "create story" in
    %(channel)s to let people start joining. When enough people have joined,
    tell %(botname)s "start story" to begin the story itself.
attrib:
  - >
    While a story is active, you can set your author line with the attrib
    command. Type "/msg %(botname)s attrib authorline" to do so.
  - >
    An author line can include your nickname, your email address, your
    website, or anything else. It will be included in the authors section
    of the story when it is finished.
story:
  - >
    Stories are moderated by %(botname)s. Each person adds a line in the story
    and, optionally, tags the next person by ending the line with @nick. For
    example:
  - >
    The man ducked under the eve of the nearest building to get out of the
    rain. @foo
  - >
    The user foo, if they are in the story, will have the opportunity to add
    the next line, and so on. A story is over when the line "The End" is
    added.
