ideas:
  echo moderated comments to meta channel
  FFA story mode - all in have voice at once
    except for the last person to speak?
  lightning round!
  nextUser algorithm: randomly order list, iterate, restart; newly-added users go to top
  command to get active users
  vote on name of story

bugs/todo:
  'attrib ' should show help
  author lines should persist
  parameterize publish directory
  handle parts
